# tSNE_visual
Python/C++ simple tools for running and visualizing t-SNE to produce 2D embeddings
The t-SNE is implemented in C++ and is a modified code taken from Laurens van der Maaten website.
A python wrapper is used to call the C++ executable and make it user friendly. The user can
choose the t-SNE hyperparameters and also produce a movie of the embeddings. This requires the ffmpeg software.
